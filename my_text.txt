Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture that combines information retrieval and natural language generation.

In traditional language models, the answers are generated based only on the model's internal knowledge. However, RAG enhances this by retrieving relevant documents from a vector database before generating the response.

The key components of a RAG pipeline include:
- A retriever: to fetch relevant documents using vector similarity.
- A generator: usually a language model like GPT or LLaMA, which takes both the user question and retrieved documents as input.

RAG is useful when dealing with constantly changing knowledge or private data that the model was never trained on.
